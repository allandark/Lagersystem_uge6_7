# Lagersystem

A simple warehouse management system that can be used for tracking orders, order status and warehouse status

## Description

This is a RESTful API utilizing a MySQL server to simulate keeping track of orders and warehouse statuses. It's useful for a variety of scenarios, including online shops, warehouse management systems, postal services, etc.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 11
* Visual Studio Code 2022
* Python 3.11

### Installing
#### Backend
* Download the code as a .zip-folder.
* Navigate to the folder, where you downloaded it.
* Open a Python terminal.
* In the terminal, create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
* Once that has been done, activate the virtual environment:
```
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
* When the virtual environment has been activated, run this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* This will install all the necessary libraries for running the program

#### Frontend
* Install node.js.
* Go to `lager-frontend` dir.
* Run commands
```
npm install
npm run build
```
### Executing program

* In Visual Studio Code:
* Open the file __init__.py.
* Run the file by pressing F5 on your keyboard.
* In the terminal, if everything works, you will see a line saying "Running on http://###.#.#.#:5000". Copy this address into your preferred web browser and write "/docs" at the end, so it looks like this: http://###.#.#.#:5000/docs
* Press Enter to go to the website.
* Right now, the website is under development. Because of this, you will see five namespaces: auth, customer, warehouse, product and order.
```
python src/app.py
