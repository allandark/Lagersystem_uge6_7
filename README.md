# Lagersystem

A simple warehouse management system that can be used for tracking orders, order status and warehouse status

## Description

This is a RESTful API utilizing a MySQL server to simulate keeping track of orders and warehouse statuses. It's useful for a variety of scenarios, including online shops, warehouse management systems, postal services, etc.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 11
* Visual Studio Code 2022
* Python 3.11

### Installing

* Download the code as a .zip-folder.
* Navigate to the folder, where you downloaded it.
* Open a Python terminal.
* In the terminal, create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
* Once that has been done, activate the virtual environment:
```
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
* When the virtual environment has been activated, run this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* This will install all the necessary libraries for running the program
### Executing program

* In Visual Studio Code:
* Open the file __init__.py.
* Run the file by pressing F5 on your keyboard.
* In the terminal, if everything works, you will see a line saying "Running on http://###.#.#.#:5000". Copy this address into your preferred web browser and write "/docs" at the end, so it looks like this: http://###.#.#.#:5000/docs
* Press Enter to go to the website.
* Right now, the website is under development. Because of this, you will see two namespaces: auth and product.
```
python src/app.py
```

### Tests
The project uses the package `pytest` to perform unit- and integration-tests.
* Open terminal (powershell/bash)
* Go to Project Root Directory
* Run the command (all tests)
```
pytest
```
* Run the command (unit tests)
```
pytest tests/unit
```
* Run the command (integration tests)
```
pytest tests/integration
```
